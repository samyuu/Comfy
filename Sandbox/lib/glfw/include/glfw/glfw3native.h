/*! @file glfw3native.h
 *  @brief The header of the native access functions.
 *
 *  This is the header file of the native access functions.  See @ref native for
 *  more information.
 */
/*! @defgroup native Native access
 *  @brief Functions related to accessing native handles.
 *
 *  **By using the native access functions you assert that you know what you're
 *  doing and how to fix problems caused by using them.  If you don't, you
 *  shouldn't be using them.**
 *
 *  Before the inclusion of @ref glfw3native.h, you may define zero or more
 *  window system API macro and zero or more context creation API macros.
 *
 *  The chosen backends must match those the library was compiled for.  Failure
 *  to do this will cause a link-time error.
 *
 *  The available window API macros are:
 *  * `GLFW_EXPOSE_NATIVE_WIN32`
 *  * `GLFW_EXPOSE_NATIVE_COCOA`
 *  * `GLFW_EXPOSE_NATIVE_X11`
 *  * `GLFW_EXPOSE_NATIVE_WAYLAND`
 *
 *  The available context API macros are:
 *  * `GLFW_EXPOSE_NATIVE_WGL`
 *  * `GLFW_EXPOSE_NATIVE_NSGL`
 *  * `GLFW_EXPOSE_NATIVE_GLX`
 *  * `GLFW_EXPOSE_NATIVE_EGL`
 *  * `GLFW_EXPOSE_NATIVE_OSMESA`
 *
 *  These macros select which of the native access functions that are declared
 *  and which platform-specific headers to include.  It is then up your (by
 *  definition platform-specific) code to handle which of these should be
 *  defined.
